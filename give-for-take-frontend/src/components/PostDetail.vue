  <h1>What We’re Reading: The Freedom to Read</h1>
  <p>Dear Medium reader,</p>
  <p>In his open letter to American librarians published on Medium this week, former President
    Barack Obama
    writes, “Your dedication and professional expertise allow us to freely read and consider information and ideas, and
    decide for ourselves which ones we agree with.” Book bans are on the rise in parts of the U.S., often focused on books
    about or by people of color and members of the LGBTQ+ community, and it’s local librarians who are often on the front
    lines of the issue. “That’s why I want to take a moment to thank all of you for the work you do every day,” Obama
    writes, “work that is helping us understand each other and embrace our shared humanity.”</p>
  <p>If you want to dig deeper, check out the new Librarians topic page, and find stories like this explainer on how
    librarians choose what books ultimately go on the shelves (from, you guessed it, a librarian), and this analysis of
    1,626 banned books supports the notion that there’s a clear ideological bent to the wave of bannings happening in the
    U.S. And give thanks for your local library!</p>
  <p>Elsewhere this week: In his piece on the Jonah Hill texting scandal, “Boy Problems”,
    Jude Ellison S. Doyle
    points to the dynamic at the heart of the conversation about boundaries and masculinity: “The language changed, but
    the fundamental demand was the same: As a man, Hill felt he had the right to control his female partner.”</p>
  <p>I also want to point you to the Medium Blog, and our new update about the Partner Program (the program that invites
    authors to create member-only content on Medium). We’re making big changes there starting in August, all in the
    service of incentivizing high-quality human writing, and making Medium better for members. Read more here.</p>
